## 📌 Rules I'm Following

- Solve at least **1 LeetCode problem every day** for 100 days.
- Problems will range across **Easy, Medium, and Hard** levels.
- Focus areas include **Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Window, Backtracking**, and more.
- I will also focus on solving SQL questions from Leetcode
- Track progress daily with solution code and brief explanations.
