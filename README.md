# 💯 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode Challenge**! 🚀  
This repository tracks my journey of solving LeetCode problems every day for 100 days to strengthen my coding, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking skills.

## 📅 Challenge Timeline

**Start Date:** April 21, 2025  
**End Date:** July 29, 2025

## 📌 Rules I'm Following

- Solve at least **2-3 LeetCode problems every day** for 100 days.
- Problems will range across **Easy, Medium, and Hard** levels.
- The first problem Focus areas include **Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Window, Backtracking**, and more.
- For the second problem, I will focus on solving **SQL questions** from Leetcode or Stratascratch
- Track progress daily with solution code and brief explanations.
